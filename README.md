# hello-world

Hello world,

I'm Eva Ruitenbeek, a citzen from Rotterdam (The Netherlands) and student at Tilburg University. A few months ago I started programming using Python and R. Im a beginner at coding but very motivated to learn to make (interactive) data visualizations! I just started with javascript and D3.js so I have a lot to practice.

My first project will be a Parallel Coordinate which I will test for my master thesis. 

Greetings
